# It's a fork of [panoskouf/mdcopy](https://github.com/panoskouf/mdcopy)

The only difference is in how the link text is formatted. Instead of using the
entire title as the link text, this extension places the link at the end of the
copied title, using the domain as the link text.

# mdcopy

this is the code for the [mdcopy chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mdcopy/jphaecfkoakhmnhpgigacoiagmhcpjnb?hl=en)


**Copy the current page link in a markdown or org-mode format to clipboard with title included.**


Useful for saving lists of links in your notes. The title of each link is generated based on the document title which is consistent with the content of the page 99% of the time.


- `Alt + i`  :: copy in markdown format
- `Alt + o` :: copy in org-mode format
- `Alt + l`  :: copy just the link
